# AsteroidSharp
Hello this is my implementation of the game Asteroids using C# and Raylib. More Specifically I am using the Raylib implementation provided by https://github.com/MrScautHD/Raylib-CSharp.

</br>
The game is nearing completion with the implementation of collision, lives, shooting lockout.

</br>
The last changes I need to implement menus to the game.

</br>
To build the game, clone the project, change directory to the Asteroids folder, build the project from that folder. Download the dotnet cli from microsoft or utilize Visual Studio (Code) to build this project. During development, I have been working on this on both linux and windows.
